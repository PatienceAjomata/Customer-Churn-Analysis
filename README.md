**Project Summary**

This project identified key factors that lead to customer churn in the telecom industry. By 
analyzing customer data, I developed KPIs, designed a user-friendly dashboard to visualize 
churn rates, use the insights from the dashboard to make data-driven suggestions that can 
help reduce churn rates.


**Business Problems, Goals and Tasks**

• Customers in the telecom industry are hard-earned; We don’t want to lose them.

• The retention department is here to get customers back in case of termination.

• Currently, we get in touch after they have terminated the contract, but this is 
reactionary; It would be better to know in advance who is at risk.

• We have done customer analysis with excel; it has always ended in a dead-end.

• We would like to know more about our customers; Visualized clearly so that it’s self explanatory for our management.


**Tasks are:**

• Define proper KPIs
• Create a dashboard for the retention manager reflecting the KPIs
• Explain your findings, and include suggestions as to what needs to be changed.



**Project Milestones**

**• Data Collection:** Gathered churn customers dataset from the telecom retention 
department.

**• Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) analysis:** Studied dataset to gain KPIs 
insight. They are;

  **1. Churn rate based on Customer’s account information:**  Payment Method, Billing 
    Method and Subscriptions duration.

  **2. Churn rate based on Customer’s demographics:** Gender-based, Senior Citizen Status, 
  Dependents and Partner status.

  **4.** **Churn rate based on Service Customer’s Signed up for:** Online Backup, Streaming
  TV, Device Protection, Phone services, Online Security, Internet ServicesFiber Optic and DSL.

**• Data Cleaning:** Removed errors and format data properly.

**• Data Analysis:** Used DAX calculation function to perform analysis and create new 
measures.

**• Dashboard Crafting:** Designed a user-friendly interface by; Selecting the
appropriate charts and other visuals to effectively represent the data, arrange them 
for clarity, readability and aesthetics, also add interactive features for deeper data 
exploration.

**Suggestions as to what needs to be done**

Based on the findings from the Churn Customer Dashboard, here are some business 
decision-making suggestions:

**1. Targeted Marketing Strategies:** Tailor marketing campaigns towards retention efforts. 
Focus on promoting automatic payment methods like electronic card transactions to 
reduce churn. Consider offering incentives for customers to switch to electronic billing to 
potentially decrease churn rates.

**3. Subscription Duration Analysis:** Since customers on month-to-month contracts have 
the highest churn rate, consider offering incentives for longer-term contracts. Encourage 
customers to opt for longer subscription durations by providing discounts or additional 
perks.

**4. Demographic Segmentation:** Analyze the demographic insights to personalize 
customer experiences. Develop targeted offerings for different customer segments based 
on gender, age groups, and household compositions. This can help improve customer 
satisfaction and loyalty.

**5. Service Optimization:** Focus on improving the quality and value proposition of 
services with high churn rates, such as Phone Services. Consider enhancing these services, 
providing better customer support, or offering bundled deals to retain customers.

**6. Internet Service Strategy:** Since a significant portion of churn users are Fiber Optic 
and DSL users, analyze the reasons behind their churn. Consider improving service 
quality, addressing common issues, or offering promotions to retain these customers.
